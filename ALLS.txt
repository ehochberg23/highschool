    are meditating on virginity
    ay have some stain of soldier in  let me ask
you a
    question man enemy to virginity  how may we barricado it
    against him
    keep him out
    he assails  our virginity though valiant in
the
    defence weak unfold to us some warlike resistance
    there none man setting down before will
    undermine blow up
    bless our poor virginity from underminers and
blowers-up 
    there no military policy how virgins might blow up men
    virginity being blown down man will quicklier be
blown
    up  marry in blowing him down again with breach
yourselves
     made lose your city not politic in the
commonwealth
    of nature to preserve virginity loss of virginity is
rational
    increase  there was never virgin got till virginity was
first
    lost that were made of metal to make virgins
virginity
    being once lost may ten times found  being ever
kept it
    ever lost 'tis too cold companion  away with't
    will stand 't little though therefore die a
    virgin
    there's little said in 't  'tis against the
rule
    of nature to speak on part of virginity to accuse
your
    mothers  which most infallible disobedience he that hangs
    himself virgin  virginity murders itself should be
    buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a
desperate
    offendress against nature virginity breeds mites much like
a
    cheese  consumes itself to very paring dies with
    feeding his own stomach besides virginity peevish
proud
    idle made of self-love which most inhibited sin in
the
    canon keep not  cannot choose lose by't out
with't
    within ten year will make itself ten which goodly
    increase  principal itself not much worse away
    with't
    how might one do sir to lose to her own liking
    let me see marry ill to like him that ne'er it
likes
    'tis commodity will lose gloss with lying  longer
kept
    less worth off with't while 'tis vendible  answer the
time
    of request virginity like an old courtier wears her cap
out of
    fashion richly suited unsuitable  just like brooch
and
    toothpick which wear not now your date better in
your
    pie your porridge than in your cheek your virginity
    your old virginity like one of our french wither'd pears
it
    looks ill eats drily  marry 'tis wither'd pear  was
    formerly better  marry 'tis wither'd pear will you
    anything with it
    not virginity yet
    there shall your master have thousand loves
    mother mistress friend
    phoenix captain an enemy

    of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
    that blinking cupid gossips now shall he-
    know not what he shall god send him well 
    court's learning-place he one-
    what one i' faith
    that wish well 'tis pity-
    what's pity
    that wishing well had not body in't
    which might felt  that we poorer born
    whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
    might with effects of them follow our friends
    show what we alone must think which never
    returns us thanks

                   

   monsieur parolles lord calls     

    little helen farewell  remember i
will
    think of at court
    monsieur parolles were born under charitable
star
    under mars i
    especially think under mars
    why under mars
    wars hath kept under that must needs be
born
    under mars
    when he was predominant
    when he was retrograde think rather
    why think so
    go much backward when fight
    that's advantage
    running away when fear proposes safety but
the
    composition that your valour fear makes in a
virtue of
    good wing like wear well
    am full of business cannot answer thee
acutely i
    will return perfect courtier  in which instruction
shall
    serve to naturalize wilt capable of a
courtier's
    counsel understand what advice shall thrust upon 
else
    diest in thine unthankfulness thine ignorance makes
    away farewell when hast leisure say prayers 
    when hast none remember friends get good
    husband use him as he uses farewell
 
    our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
    which we ascribe to heaven fated sky
    gives us free scope  only doth backward pull
    our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
    what power which mounts love high
    that makes me see cannot feed mine eye
    mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    to join like likes kiss like native things
    impossible strange attempts to those
    that weigh their pains in sense do suppose
    what hath been cannot who ever strove
    to show her merit that did miss her love
    king's disease-my project may deceive me
    intents are fix'd will not leave me

    none better than to let him fetch off his drum
which
    hear him confidently undertake to do
    with troop of florentines will suddenly
surprise
    him  such will have whom am sure he knows not from the
enemy

other
    that he carried into leaguer of adversaries
when
    we bring him to our own tents your lordship present
at
    his examination  he do not promise of his life
and in
    highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray and
    deliver all intelligence in his power against and

    judgment in anything
    love of laughter let him fetch his
drum  he
    says he has stratagem for't when your lordship sees the
bottom
    of his success in't to what metal counterfeit lump

    excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own
    wings to rend our own soldiers 
    that was not to blam'd in command of the
    service  was disaster of war that caesar himself could
not
    have prevented he had been there to command
    well we cannot greatly condemn our success
    some dishonour we had in loss of that drum  not
to
    recovered
    might have been recovered

    to recovered that merit of service
is
    seldom attributed to true exact performer would
have

    where did find then

    were yours none of all these ways
    how could give him

    woman's an easy glove lord  she goes off on

    ring was mine gave his first wife
    might yours hers aught know
    take her away do not like her now 
    to prison with her away with him
    unless tell'st me where hadst ring
    diest within hour
    never tell you

    jove ever knew man 'twas you
    wherefore hast accus'd him all while
    because he's guilty he not guilty
    he knows am no maid he'll swear to't
    swear am maid he knows not
    great king am no strumpet life 
    am either maid else old man's wife
                                            
    she does abuse our ears  to prison with her
    good mother fetch bail stay royal sir 
                                                      
    jeweller that owes ring sent for
    he shall surety me lord
    who hath abus'd me as he knows himself
    though he never harm'd me here quit him
    he knows himself bed he hath defil'd 
    at that time he got his wife with child
    dead though she she feels her young one kick 
    there's riddle one that's dead quick-
    now behold meaning

                    

    there no exorcist
    beguiles truer office of mine eyes
    is't real that see
    no good lord 
    'tis shadow of wife see
    name not thing
    both both  pardon 
    good lord when was like maid
    found wondrous kind there your ring
    look here's your letter says
    'when from finger get ring
    are me with child' etc done
    will mine now are doubly won
    she liege make me know clearly
    love her dearly ever ever dearly
    appear not plain prove untrue
    deadly divorce step between me you 
    dear mother do see living
    mine eyes smell onions  shall weep anon 
    good tom drum lend me handkercher 
    thank wait on me home make sport with 
    let curtsies alone they are scurvy ones
    let us from point to point story know
    to make even truth in pleasure flow
      beest fresh uncropped flower
    choose husband pay dower 
    guess that honest aid
    kept'st wife herself thyself maid-
    of that all progress more less
    resolvedly more leisure shall express
    all seems well  end meet
    bitter past more welcome sweet      


                           

    king's beggar now play done
    all well ended suit won
    that express content  which we will pay
    with strife to please day exceeding day
    ours your patience then yours our parts 
    your gentle hands lend us take our hearts

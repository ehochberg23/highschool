Description: This program manipulates strings. Given a character string and a list of functions that operate on strings, the resulting string is calculated.
Bugs: No bugs
Plan:
    1) Take input
    2) Split input at the slash
    3) Split at dash
    4) Call the function
    5) Return manipulated string
